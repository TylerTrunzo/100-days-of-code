# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started intro to Javascript on Codecademy

**Thoughts:** It seems like there are a lot of functions to remember, but I am learning the basics. My goal is to create a website that tracks the in-season cup tracker. Will be awhile before I get there though


### Day 1: October 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**:I practiced some more Javascript on Codecademy as well as starting the HTML course. My goal is to use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to format a web page for the in season cup tracker. I think I'll have to learn how to incorporate an API for pulling game scores, but that will come later. The website is my overall goal for this 100 days

**Thoughts** It seems confusing at first, but I have to remind myself that it's okay not to get things correct on the first try and trial and error is a valid way to get things done.
